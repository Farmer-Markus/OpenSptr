A recreation of the Nintendo Ds game The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks <br>

I'm using c++ and [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) to get access to audio, video and controls. <br>
Big thanks to: <br>

This is work in progress and could take years to finish! <br>
I've never created or reverse engineered a game before so don't expect too much. <br>
